  "summary": "This case came to the SJC through a Complaint filed against the Savannah River Presbytery (\u201cSRP\u201d) by TE David Senters, Pastor of New Covenant Presbyterian Church in Richmond Hill, Georgia.  The Complaint challenged a portion of Presbytery\u2019s action in examining TE Jonathan Stamberg, who was seeking a transfer into SRP from the Metro Atlanta Presbytery.  Specifically, the Complaint challenged Presbytery\u2019s conclusion that TE Stamberg\u2019s stated difference with our Standards concerning the gift of tongues was in fact not a difference.  Once denied by a Judicial Commission of Presbytery, TE Senters brought the Complaint to the SJC, a Panel of which heard the Complaint on March 21, 2023.",
